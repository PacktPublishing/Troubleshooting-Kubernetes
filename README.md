# Troubleshooting-Kubernetes

This is the code repository for [Troubleshooting Kubernetes [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/cloud-networking/troubleshooting-kubernetes-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.

## About the Video Course
Containers are changing the way applications are developed, deployed, and managed. Consequently, container orchestration has become a critical piece of infrastructure for enterprises on their digital transformation journey. Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has become the de-facto standard for container orchestration.
This course provides a tour of how to debug issues with the Kubernetes cluster infrastructure and presents a working conceptual model of how clusters operate. You will be addressing common problems faced by developers in cluster management, monitoring, and logging. Subsequently, we examine common issues when creating and deploying apps on Kubernetes.
By the end of the course, you'll have gained full control of your Kubernetes infrastructure and will be able to manage it with ease.
Please note a working knowledge of Kubernetes is required for this course.
